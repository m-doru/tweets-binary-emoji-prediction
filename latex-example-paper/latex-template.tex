\begin{abstract}
  An important challenge in text classification tasks is obtaining the proper embeddings
  on which the \textit{usual suspects} can be trained. We present in this report
  our work with three types of text embeddings - GloVe, Fasttext and Sent2vec - that we used to 
  to create a baseline with models like Logistic Regression and SVM with linear kernel, but also to put in place our best-performing model based on a meta ensembling pipeline composed of neural networks as base predictors and a linear model as the stacking model.
